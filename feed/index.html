Most of them have gone MIA, others have died from natural causes, and more than a few from supernatural causes (puddles and other small bodies of water have the tendency of materializing around his phone when he's not paying attention). Anyway this has lead to 80% of his posts on facebook being about the current status of his phone, and that is just annoying and not very efficient.   So yeah that's what this is for! A place to check chisco's phoneatioship status in "real time" heh xdd. . . fml</em></p>
